SMART on FHIR
=============

This is an iOS and OS X framework for building apps that interact with healthcare data through [**SMART on FHIR**](http://docs.smartplatforms.org).
Written in _Swift_ it is compatible with iOS 7+ and OS X 10.9+, building the framework requires Xcode 6.
We have a simple [medication list](https://github.com/p2/SoF-MedList) sample app so you can see how you use the framework.


Installation
------------

Use `git` to obtain the framework.
Using Terminal.app, navigate to your project directory and execute:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/p2/SMART-on-FHIR-Cocoa

This will download the latest codebase and all dependencies.
Once this process completes open your app project in Xcode and add `SMART-on-FHIR.xcodeproj`.


Documentation
-------------

Technical documentation for framework usage TBD.
Make sure to take a look at the [official SMART on FHIR documentation](http://docs.smartplatforms.org).
